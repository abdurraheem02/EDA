# EDA_Zomato
## Project Overview

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to gain insights into the restaurant landscape, cuisines, average cost, user ratings, and other attributes. By conducting EDA, we aim to understand the key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data, facilitating data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for the food industry.

## Data Source

The Zomato dataset used for this analysis is sourced from kaggle. The dataset contains detailed information about restaurants, their menus, ratings, and other attributes required for the analysis.

## Requirements

To run the EDA code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version x.x)
- Pandas (version x.x)
- Numpy (version x.x)
- Matplotlib (version x.x)
- Seaborn (version x.x)
- Jupyter Notebook (version x.x) [optional, if using Jupyter notebook]

## Getting Started

1. Download the Zomato dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `/data` folder.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (or your preferred Python environment) and run the `zomato_eda.ipynb` script to execute the exploratory data analysis.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

│   zomato_eda.ipynb
│   requirements.txt
└───data/
│   │   zomato_dataset.csv
└───results/

│       │   rating_vs_votes.png
│       │   cuisine_distribution.png
│       │   ...
```

## EDA Findings and Visualizations

After running the `zomato_eda.ipynb` script, the EDA findings and visualizations will be saved in the `/results` directory. The EDA report can be found in `eda_report.pdf`, which includes key insights, visualizations, and statistical summaries of the data.

## Visualizations

Several visualizations are generated during the EDA, highlighting important patterns and relationships in the data. Key visualizations include geographical distribution of restaurants, Top 3 countries , aggregate rating versus rating count
